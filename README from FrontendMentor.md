# NFT Card Component

## Introduction

This project is a front-end challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). It's designed to replicate a NFT card component showcasing various CSS techniques, focusing on the flex model, hover pseudo-elements, and overall understanding of the box model and margins. The goal is to create a visually appealing NFT card that would fit well in a modern web application.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
  - Flexbox
  - Hover Pseudo-elements (`:hover`)
  - Importing Fonts (`@import url`)

## Features

In this project, I implemented various front-end techniques:

- **Flexbox**: Utilized flexbox to create a responsive layout that adjusts to the content's size and screen space.
- **Hover Effects**: Added interactivity to the card. For instance, the eye icon appears over the image on hover using the `::before` pseudo-element, demonstrating an understanding of complex CSS selectors.
- **Animations**: Implemented subtle animations, such as rotating icons and color changes during the active state, to enhance user engagement and explore more advanced CSS techniques.
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Used CSS variables for color and font sizes, making the design more maintainable and the CSS reusable.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I've learned and solidified my understanding of several key front-end development concepts:

- **Flex Model**: Gained a deeper understanding of flexbox properties, including `justify-content`, `align-items`, and `flex-direction`.
- **Box Model**: Explored how elements' dimensions and spacing are calculated and controlled in CSS.
- **Hover Pseudo-elements**: Learned to enhance interactivity and user experience by showing additional information or styling when users hover over elements.
- **HTML Structure**: Improved HTML structuring and learned to create a more semantic and accessible markup.
- **Margins and Padding**: Experimented with various margin and padding values to achieve the desired spacing and alignment.

## Reflection

As I continue my journey in learning front-end development, projects like these are invaluable. They challenge me to apply concepts in real-world scenarios and encourage me to experiment and learn from doing. I've discovered the importance of clean, maintainable code and the impact of subtle design features like hover effects and responsive layouts.
